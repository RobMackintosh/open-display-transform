# Utilities
Here are a couple of utility DCTLs for doing basic operations in Resolve.

## GamutConvert
Converts from one gamut to another. Calculates a 3x3 Matrix at machine precision, does not rely on pre-defined matrices.

## LogConvert
Convert from to or from a log encoding. Implemented directly in code (no luts), so good precision. Includes links to the original source whitepapers where possible.
