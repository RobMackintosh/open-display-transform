# Open Display Transform

A collection of tools and experiments related to [Picture Formation](https://github.com/sobotka/scise/wiki/Picture-Formation), in which we attempt to create a pleasing picture out of raw camera image data.

Most tools are available as a node for Nuke, and as a DCTL for Resolve Studio.

## Picture Formation Approaches
* **[OpenDRT](display-transforms/opendrt/)** - A sophisticated picture formation approach that attempts to place as much control as possible into the hands of the image author.
* **[Tesseract](display-transforms/tesseract/)** - A picture formation approach using the max and min of rgb norms.
* **[Chromagnon](display-transforms/chromagnon)** - A simple though cheekily named Per-Channel picture formation approach, elaborating on [this acescentral post](https://community.acescentral.com/t/per-channel-display-transform-with-wider-rendering-gamut/3768), and arguably, a riff on the [AgX](https://github.com/sobotka/AgX-S2O3) idea.
* **[JzDT](display-transforms/jzdrt/)** - A very old and flawed experiment using the JzAzBz perceptual colorspace for purity compression hue angle distortion.
